	<description>Recovered from the corrupted memory core of a crashed colonial freighter near a neutron star, the AS-44 is a prototype assault rifle born in the final days of Old Earth’s last great war. Originally designed in 1944 by Soviet engineer Alexey Sudayev, it was chambered for the then-experimental 7.62×39mm cartridge — a bold step toward mobile, automatic infantry arms.

Few were ever produced. Too heavy, too complex, too soon — the AS-44 was shelved and forgotten as Earth slid into ruin. But centuries later, fragments of its schematics were salvaged and rebuilt on the Rim. The rifle returned, not refined, but powerful.

An unfinished weapon from a fallen world, reborn in desperation. Brutal. Rare. Real.
